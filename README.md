# Bike Rides API

This project aims to demonstrate the use of DDD, CQRS, event sourcing and hexagonal architecture to build an API for a bike rides business.
The project is loosely based on and inspired by Lime Bikes, since I've been using them to get around the city for some time now and have really come to enjoy this mode of transport!

In order to flex the API from a semi-realistic client there's [an accompanying Android app](https://github.com/tomcant/bike-rides-app) built using React Native.
